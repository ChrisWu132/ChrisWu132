### Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at USC, with a background as a product manager, software engineer, and tech entrepreneur. I'm passionate about building scalable web and AI-driven applications that solve real-world problems. I like to see myself as a **vibe coder**.

- 🔭 I've built [telos](https://github.com/telos-study/telos), an AI learning platform that generates personalized learning paths and multimedia materials. I handled the backend, AI, and deployment.
- 🔭 Check out my [axtree-devtools](https://github.com/ChrisWu132/axtree-devtools). It's a tool for visualizing accessibility tree changes in the browser, aiming to improve testing for GUI agents.
- ✍️ I write about AI and tech on  [Medium](https://medium.com/@chriswhp04)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love playing ping pong (I was a USC varsity captain!) and cooking.
